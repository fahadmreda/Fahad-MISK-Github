*analysis* of the best food for  **Chickens**

```{r output="asis"  ,echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
chickwts %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>%
  summarise(n = length(feed),
            Average = mean(weight), 
            SD = sd(weight)) %>% kable()
  

```
We can go **through** the plots to have a better understanding 



**PLOTS**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(chickwts, aes( x = feed, y =  weight )) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```


the below plot shows the average weight of the chicken while feeding on certain diet 



```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(chickwts, aes( feed, weight )) + 
    geom_jitter( width = 0.15 ) + 
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl,
                 fun.args = list(mult = 1), col = "red")
```

the increase and decrease of weight for each type of food 

```{r output="asis", echo = FALSE}
chickwts_lm <- lm(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
chickwts_lm 
```

```{r}
The_one_way <- anova(chickwts_lm)

The_one_way


```
Tukey’s Post-hoc test:


```{r}
## Tukey’s Post-hoc test
chickwts.av <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
tukeyTest <- TukeyHSD(chickwts.av)
datatable(tukeyTest$feed )
```
